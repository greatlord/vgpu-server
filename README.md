Unix. 

Plans 

 * Make OpenCL 	communcate over network
 * Make OpenGL 	communcate over network

 * Make Cuda	communcate over network
 * write a grapchie card driver that commucate over network ( real vgpu )

Todo 

 * Find a lightway network library that is can be in close soruces (Done)
 * Define protocoll for commucations (ToDo) 
 * Support mulit connections with tracking (ToDo)
 * Write OpenCL dll with icd interface (ToDo)
 * Write vulka dll with icd interface (ToDo)
 * Write Cuda dll with icd interface (ToDo)
 * Write a grapchie card driver (ToDo)

 * Better build system makefiles ?? (ToDo)
